## About me

The details of my life are quite inconsequential... Very well, where do I begin?

Born and raised in Tampa, Florida, I was fortunate to have private school teachers as parents which allowed me to experience childhood with immense privilege and a good education. I sought to pay back my good fortune by serving in the Army after high school, and I was able to secure a nomination to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. I married my high school sweetheart after graduating with a bachelor's in Engineering Management and served for eight years as a Signal Officer in the Southeastern United States as well as Iraq and Liberia.

Despite my consistently positive evaluations and citations - including a Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service, I never felt that I was suited to the military and officership in particular. In fact, my chosen profession was a source of significant anxiety and mental hardship, which drove me to explore other areas of interest which felt more natural to me. One of those areas was software, and when [a mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128722076) I'd built for my own pleasure became wildly popular, I experienced for the first time what it felt like to build something which others found valuable.

It was a long journey from this first sensation to realizing the career potential of computer programming, but with the encouragement of personal heroes like [John Callaway](https://twitter.com/matsubonsai) and [Adam Recvlohe](https://twitter.com/adamrecvlohe), I landed my first developer job in 2017 doing fullstack work in the Microsoft ecosystem. The demands of that first role led me to discover the power and pleasure of building dynamic client applications on the web with React, and the rest is history.

This site intends to be a collection of the talks I give, the articles I write, and blurbs about what I'm currently working on outside of work.
